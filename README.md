🌱 Food Production Sustainability Analysis

In this project i analyzed the environmental impact of different food products using the Food_Production dataset. It focuses on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water consumption, and the role of production stages such as farming, animal feed, transport, and packaging.


📊 Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are to answer key business questions, including:

- Which foods have the highest greenhouse gas emissions per 100g of Protein?

- How does land use differ between plant-based and animal-based foods?

- Which 5 foods use the most freshwater per kilogram?

- Which foods have the lowest overall environmental impact?

- What are the top five foods with the highest total from the farm and animal feed?

- What are the top five foods has the highest total from the packing and transport??

- What are the top five foods best protein with the lowest emissions?


🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Pandas – data cleaning & transformation

- Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization

- Jupyter Notebook – exploratory analysis


🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Standardized column names for easier analysis.

- Handled missing values by dropping columns with too many gaps and filling smaller gaps with 0.

- used KNN for filling null values

- Categorized foods into plant-based and animal-based groups for EDA.

- Selected key indicators: total emissions, land use, and water withdrawals.


📈 Visualizations & Insights

The analysis includes:

- Bar charts of top emitters and water users.

- Violin and swam plots comparing land use vs. emissions.

- Boxplots contrasting plant-based and animal-based foods.
